I spent some effort on this one but it was very fun and a good experince though

So lets directly begin :D

At first glance while you still exploring the chellange you see the link to [the chellange](http://ec2-54-93-122-202.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com/404/)

And the phrase **Sometimes you should see all the request faces!**

Burp suite scope is set to the chellange and started surfing it

The default page is a page indicating 404 error with a link to direct the user to a contact admin page

I started the directory brute forcing with burp suite before anything

Then I checked the contact admin page which had an email and first 5 digits of a phone number with 9 digits missing

First I thought of searching for this email in some leaked databases but no result

The phone number is worthless because it's not complete..

After few minutes the brute force got a result for a login page

The login form had three parameters:

-username

-password

-access (which was hidden and set to admin)

I tried to sql inject it but with no result

Tried to brute force with username admin and a password list but no result too

I was stuck in this step

I took a little break to clear my mind and returned and reviewed what's happened from the beginning to see if I'm missing something

I read the phrase at the chellange beginning **Sometimes you should see all the request faces!**

Then I realized that it's a hint!

So I went to the chellange link and changed the request method to POST instead of GET and I got what I'm looking for :D

There's a comment appeared in the page source code containing MD5 hash `c54f73655a0d69605e24980a0e055b94`

The first thing I do with MD5 hashed is cracking it with rainbow tables sites

I tried to crack this hash using 4 sites but non of them fount a result

I was stuck again for a little while and didn't know how to crack this hash

Untill that **ask Google** idea raise on my mind

So I searched with the same hash in google engine in hope to find some result for it 

And my hope was in the place

Thanks Google, I found a list with cracked MD5 hashes which contained the required hash 

And the value of the hash was **p4ssw0rD**

And finally I got the password!

The next step is to login and hoping this is the last trick on this chellange

I logged in with username **admin** and password **p4ssw0rD**

And this page appeared

I was hoping that there's no more tricks but this one wasn't an obstacle

I know which value to change to access as a user

I returned to the login page and logged in again with the same user and password and intercepted the request with Burp to change the access parameter from admin to user

`username=admin&password=p4ssw0rD&access=user`

### And BINGO!!

Got the flag :D `Flag{d0_n0t_5t0p_t35t!ng}`
